    "* Complicated images like flowers can have high similarity with totally different images due to the similar distribution of colors. It is because we do not count the relative position of the pixels. If we start to count relative positions we can get another problem: the same object but from a different angle will not match. Distributions of pixels intensity will be the same but the coordinates will be different.\n",
